I'm using this repository to learn to program games in Java. I'd like to
program a simple platformer, and then maybe an action-adventure game like
Zelda. Although I'm sure there are plenty of tools out there that I could be
taking advantage of, I plan to program most things from scratch, just to learn
the process. I do hope to use open-source sprite collections like spritelib for
art, at least to start out. Since I'll be working on game programming in my
free time, my progress will probably be very slow and uneven.
