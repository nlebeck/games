This repository holds my game programming code.
The first project I'm working on is an action-adventure game (like Zelda) in Java.
Although I'm sure there are plenty of tools out there that I could be taking
advantage of, I plan to program most things from scratch, just to learn the
process. I hope to use open-source sprite collections like spritelib for art
or create my own sprites.

I based the main game loop in my Java game on the game loop from the online
draft of "Killer Game Programming in Java" by Andrew Davison, but aside from
that, I'm mostly just figuring things out on my own.
