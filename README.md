I'm using this repository to learn to program games in Java. Eventually, I'd
like to program a simple platformer or an action-adventure game like Zelda.
Although I'm sure there are plenty of tools out there that I could be taking
advantage of, I plan to program most things from scratch, just to learn the
process. I hope to use open-source sprite collections like spritelib for art,
at least to start out.

My main reference as of right now is the online draft of "Killer Game
Programming in Java" by Andrew Davison.
